## Inspiration
Our team was inspired by Google's T-Rex runner, built in voice controls in Unity, as well as the Crazy Frog animated music character from 2003. Although there are a lot of games on the market right now, not many of them explore the option of voice control. This is why we decided to combine these observations and inpirations to create Voice Runner. 

## What it does
Voice Runner is a web game that allows players to control the movement of the character using their voice. The frog character would continue to run until it faces an obstactle and the player has to say "Jump" to make the character jump to skip the obstacle. Voice Runner is ment to be entrertaining through the use of voice commands and user friendly with custom made artwork. 

## How We built it
Our team used Unity, C#, and Adobe XD for user experence. Although we were not able to deploy the game on time, we were on the other hand able to make some part of the game functional. 

## Challenges we ran into
This was the first time we worked on developing a game and none of us worked with technologoes like Unity and C# language before. The greatest challenge was collaborating on the code from Unity in github because there were lots of merge conflics and at times the code had to be re-writed again due to bugs. Another challenge was time managment since the hackathon was only 24 hours. We managed to get through everything by focusing on our strengths and making an MVP rather than trying to make everything perfect.‚ú®


## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
We are proud that despite of the fear of trying something completely new, our teamw as still able to create an MVP of the Voice Runner Game. Both the design and development took trial and error but we are proud of how the game turned out!üé®  

## What we learned
How to use the game development engine Unity to develop a game. We also learned about the C# langauge which was used throughout Unity to develop Voice Runner. 

# What's next for Voice Runner?
Our next steps are to add more levels to the game with better score keeping and improve the voice controll feature of the game.
