Inspiration
Our team wanted to address the X challenge presented by (SBUHacks, Sponsor, community member, etc.)

What it does
Our project address the challenge by doing X.

How We built it
Our team used X, Y, Z and deployed our project to mobile/cloud/local/etc. for ease of access!

Challenges We ran into
This was our first hackathon, I didn't know how to code before this weekend!, we didn't know how to reach the egress point of our simulated service. Whatever you ran into, overcame, or were unable to solve, let everyone know here.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The button shadow on hover effect is very enjoyable.

What we learned
How to code, react, etc.

What's next for "[EXAMPLE] TEMPLATE SUBMISSION"
I hope some hackers learn how to write good Devpost submissions

Checkout some of these photos of our hack in action!!
